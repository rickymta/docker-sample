# Commit Conventions
We follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) to write the commit messages.
The commit message should be structured as follows:

```
<type>: <subject>
empty separator line
<optional body>
empty separator line
<optional footer>

```

# Type
Type must be one of the following:

- **feat**: a new feature
- **fix**: a bug fix
- **refactor**: a change that refactor the current code
- **style**: changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc.)
- **test**: adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- **docs**: documentation only changes
- **chore**: a catch-all type for any other commits. Use it if you can not use any other types for your changes. For instance modifying the .gitignore. Also, if you're implementing a single feature (or bug fix) and it makes sense to divide the work into multiple commits, you should mark one commit as feat and the rest as chore.

## Subject
The subject contains a succinct description of the change.

- Is a mandatory part of the format
- Use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
- Don't capitalize the first letter
- No dot (.) at the end

## Body
The body should include the motivation for the change and contrast this with previous behavior.

- Is an optional part of the format
- Use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"

## Footer
The footer is the place to reference Issues that this commit refers to.

- Is an optional part of the format
- optionally reference an issue by its id.
